# MD2

This just a simple library which creates MD2 hashes

⚠️ MD2 hashes are considered **insecure** and should **not** be used, I've created and packaged this just as an exercise for fun.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     md2:
       github: domant3lis/md2
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "md2"
```

## Contributing

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/domant3lis/md2.git>)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the main branch (`git push origin main`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
